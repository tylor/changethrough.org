        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Public space is defined as a social area that is free and accessible to all, regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, or socio-economic level. How do we as citizens interact with public space? More importantly, how can we use public space as a vehicle for positive social change?</p>
        <p>On February 10, 2011, we invited three speakers to share their perspectives on change through public space. Their thoughts provided us with ample material to explore, dissect, and challenge ourselves to find new and different ways to engage with our community.</p>

          <blockquote><span class="sixtysix">&ldquo;</span>Without public space, these [social and economic] problems would be pushed aside and ignored, and the pressure to solve these problems would be much reduced. So as well as an important vehicle for people to have meaningful expression or a meaningful way of meeting their needs, it's an important way of expressing need for political change.<span class="ninetynine">&rdquo;</span></blockquote>

        <p>What will you do with public spaces now?</p>
        <p>We'd like to thank our speakers for taking the time and effort to explore our theme. They provided insightful and provocative discussion that helped us understand issues around public space more clearly and frame the rest of the evening.</p>
        <p>We'd also like to thank the NetworkHub for their venue, support, and participation in Change Through.</p>
