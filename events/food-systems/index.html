        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Food is something that we often put in our bodies without a second thought. At Change Through, we decided that a dialogue around Food Systems is something we all need.</p>
        <p>Food systems is a term that encapsulates many things: food production, food security, sustainability, and conscious consumption. As urban citizens, how do we engage in food systems? In an age where most people in urban centres don't produce their own food, how do we critically examine how we consume what keeps us alive? How do we think about a thing that is typically viewed as an apolitical issue?</p>
        <p>On May 3, 2011, we invited three speakers and one moderator to spark conversation about social change through food systems. They challenged us to think about serious issues surrounding humans' most basic need, and how to carry those challenges out into the community.</p>

          <h3>Anthony Nicalo &mdash; <span class="role">Chef and entrepreneur, Foodtree.com</span></h3>
          <p>Anthony Nicalo has spent his career as a chef and entrepreneur dedicated to the notion that story should be a key ingredient in everything we consume: the story of what, the story of where, the story of when, the story of how, and the story of why. His passion for food systems has been demonstrated through Inevitable Table, Farmstead Wines, nonprofit Farmfed, and most recently Foodtree, a global, participatory database of local food.</p>
          <p>Anthony, our moderator, stressed that we should keep in mind that everyone in the room was very optimistic about the topic, but also somewhat pessimistic about the large scale of the food systems issue. Reminded us to always keep in mind the support of the choir when attempting to make a difference to others.</p>

        <p>After a lengthy discussion, a few people looking at actions to follow up on tonight's learnings. One person said he would use social media as a tool to remind people to think about food as something other than nourishment. Two people plan on connecting later to engage others in developing a food systems policy for Canada. Most people in the room agreed to think about the language they use around discussing food thanks to a comment by Joyce from the Downtown Eastside Food Bank about "food sovreignty" and food as a basic human right. Arzeena and another person will take this opportunity to promote the Richmond Food Security's May conference.</p>
        <p>What will you do about food systems now?</p>
